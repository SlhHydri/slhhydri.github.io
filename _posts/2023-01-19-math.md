Integrals can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, you might need to calculate the arc length of a curve given by function $y = f(x)$.

This can be done quite simply using the following formula.

The arc length $S$ of the curve $y = f(x)$ from point $x = a$ to $x = b$ is given by:

$$
S = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+f^{2}(x)} \,dx \
$$

If your function is expressed as $x=f(y)$, the following formula can be of more use:

$$
S = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+x'^{2}} \,dx \
$$

Finally, for a given polar curve, expressed as $r=f(\theta)$, you may use:

$$
S = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sqrt{f^2(\theta)+f'^{2}(\theta)} \,d\theta \
$$

Hope this comes in useful!
