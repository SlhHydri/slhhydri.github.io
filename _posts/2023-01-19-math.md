Integrals can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, you might need to calculate the arc length of a curve given by function $$ y = f(x) $$. This can be done quite simply using the following formula.
The arc length $$ S $$ of the curve $$ y = f(x) $$ from point $$ x = a $$ to $$ x = b $$ is given by:

$$
\S = [ \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+f^{2}(x)} \,dx \]
$$
